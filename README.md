### Server Evolution Made Easy.

#### Evolve your servers, virtual machines and containers more easily.
Server Mechanic is a tool to apply change scripts to your servers in a reliable and reproducable way.

### Pros
* You evolve your servers step by step.
* You author server migrations in your favorite language.
* No abstractions - you simply use your daily tools (apt, yum, cp, sed, ...)
* You focus on the changes instead of developing reusable plugins.

### Cons
* List of migrations can get very long for new installs.

Server Mechanic is considered as a lightweight alternative to tools like puppet, ansible, etc.

* Written in Python.
* Uses battle proof sqlite3 database.
